# publications
All publications of the QUSP research unit, see [Uni TÃ¼bingen CQS](https://uni-tuebingen.de/cqs).

The `publications.bib` file is managed by JabRef and formatted using the git-hook.

In JabRef you can use the custom exporter `typo3` which is included in this repo. It generates the HTML file `all-typo3.html`.
If you open this file in a browser, you can copy and paste the formatted text into the typo3 element.

To revert the HTML-list you have to use the Browser HTML-editor to add the attribute `reversed=""` to the `<ol>`-tag.
