  abstract         = {Abstract. A rank-adaptive integrator for the approximate solution of high-order tensor differential equations by tree tensor networks is proposed and analyzed. In a recursion from the leaves to the root, the integrator updates bases and then evolves connection tensors by a Galerkin method in the augmented subspace spanned by the new and old bases. This is followed by rank truncation within a specified error tolerance. The memory requirements are linear in the order of the tensor and linear in the maximal mode dimension. The integrator is robust to small singular values of matricizations of the connection tensors. Up to the rank truncation error, which is controlled by the given error tolerance, the integrator preserves norm and energy for Schrödinger equations, and it dissipates the energy in gradient systems. Numerical experiments with a basic quantum spin system illustrate the behavior of the proposed algorithm.},

Yet, their generality is limited, and flexible Hamiltonian-design techniques are needed to widen the scope of these simulators. Here we report on the realization of spatially tunable interactions for XYZ models implemented by two-color near-resonant coupling to Rydberg pair states. Our results demonstrate the unique opportunities of Rydberg dressing for Hamiltonian design in analog quantum simulators.},

  abstract         = {We introduce and investigate an open many-body quantum system in which kinetically constrained coherent and dissipative processes compete. The form of the incoherent dissipative dynamics is inspired by that of epidemic spreading or cellular-automaton-based computation related to the density-classification problem. It features two nonfluctuating absorbing states as well as a Z2-symmetric point in parameter space. The coherent evolution is governed by a kinetically constrained Z2-symmetric many-body Hamiltonian which is related to the quantum XOR-Fredrickson-Andersen model. We show that the quantum coherent dynamics can stabilize a fluctuating state and we characterize the transition between this active phase and the absorbing states. We also identify a rather peculiar behavior at the Z2-symmetric point. Here the system approaches the absorbing-state manifold with a dynamics that follows a power law whose exponent continuously varies with the relative strength of the coherent dynamics. Our work shows how the interplay between coherent and dissipative processes as well as symmetry constraints may lead to a highly intricate nonequilibrium evolution and may stabilize phases that are absent in related classical problems.},

  abstract         = {We consider the nonequilibrium behavior of a central spin system where the central spin is periodically reset to its ground state. The quantum-mechanical evolution under this effectively dissipative dynamics is described by a discrete-time quantum map. Despite its simplicity this problem shows surprisingly complex dynamical features. In particular, we identify several metastable time-crystal resonances. Here the system does not relax rapidly to a stationary state but undergoes long-lived oscillations with a period that is an integer multiple of the reset period. At these resonances the evolution becomes restricted to a low-dimensional state space within which the system undergoes a periodic motion. Generalizing the theory of metastability in open quantum systems, we develop an effective description for the evolution within this long-lived metastable subspace and show that in the long-time limit a nonequilibrium stationary state is approached. Our study links to timely questions concerning emergent collective behavior in the “prethermal” stage of a dissipative quantum many-body evolution and may establish an intriguing link to the phenomenon of quantum synchronization.},

The resulting state-dependent level shifts allow us to study many-body systems displaying intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena, such as constrained spin systems, and are at the heart of numerous technological applications, e.g., in quantum simulation and computation platforms. Here, we show that these interactions also have a significant impact on dissipative effects caused by the inevitable coupling of Rydberg atoms to the surrounding electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that their presence modifies the frequency of the photons emitted from the Rydberg atoms, making it dependent on the local neighborhood of the emitting atom. Interactions among Rydberg atoms thus turn spontaneous emission into a many-body process which manifests, in a thermodynamically consistent Markovian setting, in the emergence of collective jump operators in the quantum master equation governing the dynamics. We discuss how this collective dissipation—stemming from a mechanism different from the much studied superradiance and subradiance—accelerates decoherence and affects dissipative phase transitions in Rydberg ensembles.},

  abstract         = {Dissipative many-body quantum dynamics can feature strong symmetries which give rise to conserved quantities. We discuss here how a strong symmetry in conjunction with a nonequilibrium phase transition allows to devise a protocol for measuring collective many-body observables. To demonstrate this idea we consider a collective spin system whose constituents are governed by a dissipative dynamics that conserves the total angular momentum. We show that by continuously monitoring the system output the value of the total angular momentum can be inferred directly from the time-integrated emission signal, without the need of repeated projective measurements or reinitializations of the spins. This may offer a route towards the measurement of collective properties in qubit ensembles, with applications in quantum tomography, quantum computation and quantum metrology.},

  abstract         = {Central to the field of quantum machine learning is the design of quantum perceptrons and neural network architectures. A key question in this regard is the impact of quantum effects on the way such models process information. Here, we establish a connection between (1+1)D quantum cellular automata, which implement a discrete nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics through successive applications of local quantum gates, and quantum neural networks (QNNs), which process information by feeding it through perceptrons interconnecting adjacent layers. Exploiting this link, we construct a class of QNNs that are highly structured—aiding both interpretability and helping to avoid trainability issues in machine learning tasks—yet can be connected rigorously to continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. We further analyze the universal properties of an example case, identifying a change of critical behavior when quantum effects are varied, showing their potential impact on the collective dynamical behavior underlying information processing in large-scale QNNs.},

  abstract         = {Enhanced experimental capabilities to control nonlocal and power-law decaying interactions are currently fuelling intense research in the domain of quantum many-body physics. Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged interactions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as nonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent thermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open quantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong long-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties, captured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent non-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual constituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are generated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally non-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation behavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived quasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.},
